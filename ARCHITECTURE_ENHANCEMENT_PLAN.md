# Architecture Enhancement Plan: Advanced DM/Assistant System

## Current Architecture Analysis

### **Strengths** ✅
1. **Clean Domain Modeling**: Well-structured ontology with Omniverse → Multiverse → Universe → Story → Scene hierarchy
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Director, Librarian, Steward, Narrator, Planner agents with clear responsibilities
3. **Dual Storage Strategy**: Neo4j for graph ontology + MongoDB for narrative content
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Pydantic models with strict typing
5. **Composition Pattern**: Clean service architecture replacing problematic mixins
6. **Flexible System Support**: Multiple RPG systems (D&D 3.5, PBtA, City of Mist)

### **Current Limitations** 🚧
1. **Limited Narrative Memory**: Agents lack rich context about past events, character development, relationships
2. **Shallow Character Understanding**: No persistent character memories, motivations, or relationship tracking
3. **Basic Scene Continuity**: Limited tracking of scene state, ongoing conflicts, environmental factors
4. **Minimal GM Tools**: Missing campaign management, plot thread tracking, consequence management
5. **Static Agent Roles**: Agents don't adapt behavior based on narrative context or player preferences

## Enhanced Architecture Vision

### **1. Rich Narrative Context System**

```
Current Flow:
Intent → Director → Librarian → Steward → Planner → Narrator

Enhanced Flow:
Intent → Context Enrichment → Multi-Agent Council → Narrative Generation → Memory Update
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Narrative Context Provider**: Enriches all agent inputs with relevant memories, relationships, ongoing plots
- **Character Memory System**: Persistent character understanding with relationship tracking
- **Scene State Management**: Rich scene context with environmental factors, ongoing conflicts, tension levels
- **Campaign Memory**: Long-term plot thread tracking, consequence management, foreshadowing

### **2. Advanced Agent Specialization**

#### **Enhanced Narrator**
- **Context-Aware Narration**: Adapts tone/style based on current narrative state
- **Character Voice Consistency**: Maintains consistent NPC personalities across sessions
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Rich descriptions that reinforce mood and atmosphere
- **Foreshadowing Management**: Plants seeds for future plot developments

#### **Campaign Steward (Enhanced)**
- **Continuity Enforcement**: Prevents contradictions in established facts
- **Consequence Tracking**: Ensures player actions have appropriate long-term effects
- **Pacing Management**: Adjusts narrative intensity based on session flow
- **Rules Consistency**: Maintains system-specific rule adherence

#### **Character Archivist (New)**
- **Relationship Mapping**: Tracks evolving relationships between characters
- **Character Development**: Records growth, changes, learned information
- **Motivation Tracking**: Understands and evolves character goals
- **Secret Management**: Handles information asymmetry between characters

#### **Plot Conductor (Enhanced Director)**
- **Thread Weaving**: Manages multiple concurrent plot threads
- **Tension Management**: Builds and releases narrative tension appropriately
- **Pacing Control**: Ensures satisfying story beats and cliffhangers
- **Player Agency**: Balances story direction with player choices

### **3. Intelligent Memory Architecture**

#### **Multi-Layered Memory System**
```
Immediate Context (Current Scene)
├── Active participants, location, ongoing conflicts
├── Recent dialogue and actions
└── Current tension/mood state

Session Memory (Current Session)
├── Key events and decisions
├── Character interactions and developments
└── Plot threads introduced/resolved

Campaign Memory (Long-term)
├── Character relationships and history
├── World state and established facts
└── Overarching plot threads and consequences

Meta Memory (Cross-Campaign)
├── Player preferences and styles
├── Successful narrative patterns
└── System-specific adaptations
```

#### **Smart Context Retrieval**
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritizes most relevant memories for current situation
- **Relationship-Based**: Surfaces memories based on character relationships
- **Temporal Weighting**: Recent events weighted higher than distant ones
- **Emotional Resonance**: Important emotional moments get persistent weight

### **4. Dynamic Agent Coordination**

#### **Council Mode**: Multi-agent collaboration for complex decisions
```python
# Enhanced agent council for complex narrative decisions
class NarrativeCouncil:
    def deliberate(self, context: NarrativeContext) -> CouncilDecision:
        # Multiple agents provide perspectives
        narrator_view = self.narrator.analyze_dramatic_potential(context)
        steward_view = self.steward.check_continuity_risks(context)
        archivist_view = self.archivist.assess_character_impact(context)
        conductor_view = self.conductor.evaluate_pacing(context)
        
        # Weighted decision making
        return self.synthesize_perspectives([
            narrator_view, steward_view, archivist_view, conductor_view
        ])
```

#### **Adaptive Agent Behavior**
- **Player Style Learning**: Agents adapt to player preferences over time
- **Session Mood Adjustment**: Tone shifts based on player energy and engagement
- **System-Specific Expertise**: Agents gain deeper knowledge of specific RPG systems
- **Difficulty Calibration**: Automatically adjusts challenge level based on player success

### **5. Enhanced Data Models**

#### **Narrative State Tracking**
```python
class EnhancedNarrativeState(BaseModel):
    universe_id: str
    current_scene_id: str | None
    
    # Emotional/Atmospheric State
    current_mood: str  # tense, peaceful, mysterious, exciting
    tension_level: int  # 1-10 scale
    pacing: str  # slow, moderate, fast, climactic
    
    # Plot Management
    active_plot_threads: list[PlotThread]
    pending_consequences: list[PendingConsequence]
    foreshadowing_seeds: list[ForeshadowingSeed]
    
    # Character State
    character_states: dict[str, CharacterState]
    relationship_dynamics: list[RelationshipState]
    
    # Session Management
    session_energy: int  # Player engagement level
    time_remaining: int | None  # Session time management
    preferred_focus: str  # combat, roleplay, exploration, etc.
```

#### **Rich Character Memory**
```python
class AdvancedCharacterMemory(BaseModel):
    character_id: str
    universe_id: str
    
    # Core Identity
    personality_traits: list[str]
    core_motivations: list[str]
    character_arc_stage: str

    # Emotional State
    current_emotional_state: str
    recent_emotional_events: list[EmotionalEvent]
    character_growth_markers: list[GrowthEvent]
```

### **6. Advanced LangGraph Flow**

#### **Enhanced Flow Architecture**
```python
# Multi-path narrative processing
def build_enhanced_narrative_flow():
    workflow = StateGraph(EnhancedNarrativeState)
    
    # Context Enrichment Phase
    workflow.add_node("context_enricher", enrich_narrative_context)
    workflow.add_node("memory_retriever", retrieve_relevant_memories)
    workflow.add_node("relationship_analyzer", analyze_character_relationships)

    workflow.add_node("environmental_narrator", enhance_environmental_details)
    workflow.add_node("consequence_tracker", track_action_consequences)
    
    # Memory Update Phase
    workflow.add_node("memory_updater", update_character_memories)
    workflow.add_node("relationship_updater", update_relationship_states)
    workflow.add_node("plot_thread_updater", update_plot_threads)
    
    # Smart routing based on context
    workflow.add_conditional_edges("context_enricher", route_based_on_complexity)
    workflow.add_conditional_edges("narrative_council", route_based_on_consensus)
    
    return workflow.compile()
```
